👤 FaceMorph AI – Real-Time Emotion & Age Morphing App
"Ever wondered what your face reveals about your mood or age in real time?"

FaceMorph AI isn't just another AI project — it’s a window into how machines interpret you. Built with passion using DeepFace, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, this app captures your face from the webcam, detects your emotion and age, and applies a subtle morph effect in real time — all through a clean, minimal Streamlit interface.

🚀 Features
🎭 Real-time emotion detection (Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.)

📅 Predicts age instantly via webcam

🎨 Live morphing effect that adapts with emotion and age

⚡ Fast and lightweight — works on most machines

🧠 Powered by DeepFace & OpenCV

💻 Clean UI with Streamlit


📦 Installation
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceMorphAI.git
cd FaceMorphAI
python -m venv FaceMorphAIenv
FaceMorphAIenv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

🧠 How It Works
Captures real-time frames from webcam.

Passes the image to DeepFace for emotion and age detection.

Displays the result live and morphs the face slightly based on predictions.

Updates every frame in real time with smooth performance.

🤓 Behind the Scenes
This project is part of my AI/ML portfolio — I built it not just to demonstrate technical skills, but to learn how to create interactive, human-facing AI tools. Everything here was manually coded, tested, and iterated.
